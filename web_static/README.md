# README for 0x01. AirBnB Clone - Web Static

Hello there! Welcome to my AirBnB Clone project. My name is Kryuell, and I'm a student at Alx. In this project, I've created a simple web static version of AirBnB. Below you'll find some basic information on how to navigate through this project.

## What is this project about?

This project is a part of the Alx curriculum, aimed at helping us learn the basics of web development by creating a simplified version of the popular AirBnB website. Here, we focus on the static part, meaning we're not dealing with backend functionality yet. It's all about creating the visual elements that users will interact with.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
